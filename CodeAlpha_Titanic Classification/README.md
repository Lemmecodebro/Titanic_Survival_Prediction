🛳️ Titanic Survival Prediction – Logistic Regression
This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using logistic regression. It follows a standard machine learning pipeline from data exploration to model evaluation.

📂 Dataset
The following files from the Kaggle Titanic dataset are used:

train.csv – Training data

test.csv – Test data

gender_submission.csv – Sample submission file

submission.csv – Final model predictions for the test set

📈 Workflow Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understanding data distributions and feature relationships

Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Feature selection

Model Development

Building a Logistic Regression model

Training on the cleaned dataset

Testing & Prediction

Applying the model on unseen test data

Saving predictions to submission.csv

Evaluation

Validating model performance on training data

Calculating and visualizing feature importance

✅ Output
Final predictions are stored in submission.csv

Feature importance is visualized to interpret which factors contributed most to survival
